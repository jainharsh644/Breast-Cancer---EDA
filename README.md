This repository consists of Jupyter Notebook which shows the implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis, and Machine learning models on Breast Cancer Dataset.

# Notebook Flow:

<ol>
<li>Import Required Libraries & Read the Dataset</li>
<li>Data Pre-processing: Clean the data by handling missing values if any, handle outlier, check for data imbalancment</li>
<li>Data Visualization: Get some useful insights for data to transform further</li>
<li>Feature Scaling and Selection: Transform and Identify the features which are important for model training.</li>
<li>Model Building: Trained the following machine learning models - Random Forest, SVM.</li>
</ol>

The code is written in Python 3.6.10. 
If you don't have Python installed, you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
